#### Lets generate a country song about our Love towards AI Generated Music ‚ù§Ô∏èü§†

1. We will use the **Music AI** Feature, instead of `<api_key>` use your **own API Key** from the Dashboard

2. Instead of `http://webhook.yourwebsite.com` please create a webhook on your server, when the generation is finnished we will send the url of the result to your webhook.
