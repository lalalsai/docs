#### Lets generate a country song about our Love towards AI Generated Music ‚ù§Ô∏èü§†

3. For this we will use the **Music AI** Feature, instead of `<api_key>` use your **own API Key** from the Dashboard

4. Instead of `http://webhook.yourwebsite.com` please create a webhook on your server, when the generation is finnished we will send the url of the result to your webhook. (You dont have a webhook ? Click here)
```
curl -X 'POST' \ 
'https://api.lalals.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"music_style": "Song about my love to AI Music in Country Style",
"webhook_url": "http://webhook.yourwebsite.com",
}'
```

5. When the Generation is finnished your Webhook will receive the url of the generated song.

```
{
"success": true, 
"task_id": str, 
"conversion_id": str, 
"audio_url": str (signed aws url valid for 1 day), 
"conversion_cost" : float, 
"title" : str, 
"lyrics" : str, 
"prompt" : str ('' if not available),
"music_style" : str ('' if not available)
}
```
